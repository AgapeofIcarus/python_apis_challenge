# python_apis_challenge
 UNCC Project for APIs
![Python APIs](https://github.com/AgapeofIcarus/python_apis_challenge/blob/main/equatorsign.png?raw=true)

In this two-fold project, I used APIs to analyze weather patterns and data. The requirements were as follows:

Create scatterplots to display relationships between 
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Create line regressions to display the relationships between
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Write summaries containing observations regarding the charts.

* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from WeatherPy.
* Narrow down the DataFrame to find my ideal weather condition.
* Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.
* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
